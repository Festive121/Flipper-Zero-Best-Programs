<h1><strong>Unleashed OS</strong></h1>
<p>Open qFlipper and plug in your flipper</p>
<p>On the right, click "Install from file"</p>
<p>If you cloned this repository correctly, you should have a folder titled "Unleashed OS"</p>
<p>Use the file in there</p>
<p>Here is the official repository:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware">Unleashed</a></p><br>
<h1>Files</h1>
<p>In the folder named "Files", there are a ton of programs for you to use</p>
<p>They have all been catagorized as Flipper folders, so I recommend pasting the contents of each folder into the corresponding one on the Flipper</p>
<p>ie. Files/Applications -> Flipper/Applications</p>
<p>Do this for all files in each folder</p>
<p>Using qFlipper, click the file button. Then double click the SD Card, then you can drag and drop each file into their folder.</p>
<p>How you organize it is up to you, but I recommend this.</p><br>
